# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenges, organized by language and year.

## Organization

Each language has its own directory, with subdirectories for each year.
The directory structure for each language may vary, but should be organized in a way that makes it easy to find and navigate the solutions.

Test data for the challenges can be found in the `test_data` directory under the root of the project.
This test data is specific to my input for the challenges and may not be the same as the input provided to other users.
For example, the input for the day 1 problem in 2022 can be found at `test_data/year_2022/day_01.txt`.

## Language-Specific Details

Details about building, running, and testing the code, as well as any dependencies, configuration options, and troubleshooting tips, will be covered in the `README.md` file within each language's directory.
Note that I've been formatting the `README.md` files with `Prettier` to ensure consistency in style and formatting.

## Contributing

This project is open to contributions from anyone who wishes to share their own solutions to the Advent of Code challenges.
I welcome improvements and optimizations to my solutions, as well as feedback and review.
If you'd like to contribute or have suggestions for how to improve a solution, please follow these guidelines:

- Create a new directory for your language if it doesn't already exist.
- Organize your solutions in a way that is easy to find and navigate.
- Format and style your code according to the conventions of your language.
- If the language doesn't have a `README.md` file, create one.
  You may want to use `Prettier` to format the `README.md` file for consistency with the rest of the project.
- Test your code to ensure it is correct.

To submit your contribution, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
